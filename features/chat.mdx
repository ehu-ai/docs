The Chat feature in Product Graph provides an intelligent conversational interface for working with your product documentation. Ask questions, refine requirements, and explore ideas with an AI assistant that understands your product context.

## Contextual Conversations

Chat in Product Graph isn't just a generic AI assistant—it's deeply integrated with your product documentation. The AI understands:

- Your existing artifacts and requirements
- Project context and goals
- Team terminology and conventions
- Historical decisions and their rationale

## Key Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Requirements Refinement" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Discuss and refine requirements through natural conversation. The AI helps
    identify gaps and ambiguities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Idea Exploration" icon="lightbulb">
    Brainstorm features, explore alternatives, and think through implications
    before committing to documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation Generation" icon="file-pen">
    Generate drafts of specifications, user stories, and acceptance criteria
    from your conversation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quick Answers" icon="circle-question">
    Ask questions about your existing documentation and get instant, contextual
    answers.
  </Card>

## Adding Context

Enrich your conversations by bringing in additional context beyond what's already in your product documentation.

### Attachments

Upload files directly to your chat to give the AI more context:

- **Images**: Screenshots, diagrams, wireframes, and mockups
- **PDFs**: Research documents, specifications, and reference materials

<Info>
  Support for text files including markdown, plain text, and DOCX is coming
  soon.
</Info>

### Artifact Mentions

Reference other artifacts in your messages using mentions. Type `@` to search and select any artifact in your product. The AI will pull in that artifact's content to inform its response, making it easy to ask questions that span multiple documents or compare requirements across features.

## Document Editing from Chat

When you ask the AI to edit your document through chat, changes are applied as [tracked revisions](/features/editor#change-tracking--review)—never directly overwriting your content. The AI proposes changes; you review and approve.

### Creating Child Artifacts

Beyond editing the current document, Chat can create new artifacts in your product hierarchy:

1. **Propose before creating**: The AI always proposes what it plans to create and waits for your confirmation
2. **Batch creation**: Multiple related artifacts (like several requirements) can be created in parallel
3. **Automatic linking**: New artifacts are properly linked to their parents in the hierarchy

<Info>
  The AI will never create artifacts without first explaining what it intends to
  create and receiving your approval.

## Example Prompts

### Requirements refinement

- "What edge cases should we consider for the user authentication flow?"
- "Can you help me write acceptance criteria for this user story?"
- "What's missing from this requirements document?"

### Documentation generation

- "Generate a technical specification from these requirements"
- "Create a user story for the shopping cart feature"
- "Write API documentation for the endpoints we discussed"

### Document editing

- "Add a section about security considerations"
- "Make the overview more concise"
- "Rewrite this in a more technical tone"
- "Break this long paragraph into bullet points"

### Context questions

- "What decisions have we made about the payment system?"
- "Show me all requirements related to user onboarding"
- "What was the reasoning behind using GraphQL?"
