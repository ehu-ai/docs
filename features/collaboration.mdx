Product Graph is built for teams. Every document, artifact, and specification supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple team members to work together simultaneously without conflicts or version confusion.

## Real-Time Editing

When multiple users open the same document, all changes sync instantly. There's no need to "check out" documents or worry about overwriting each other's work—the system handles concurrent editing automatically.

### How It Works

Product Graph uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to merge simultaneous edits without data loss. When you make a change:

1. Your edit is applied locally immediately
2. The change is synchronized to other connected users within milliseconds
3. All users see a consistent view of the document

This architecture ensures a responsive editing experience even with multiple collaborators and handles network interruptions gracefully.
