Documents are general-purpose, flexible artifacts for capturing and organizing knowledge within your organization. Unlike artifacts in the [product hierarchy](/features/product-artifacts#the-artifact-hierarchy), Documents exist independently as standalone content containers that can hold any type of documentation, notes, or information relevant to your team.

## What are Documents?

Documents serve as your organizational knowledge base, providing a space for content that doesn't fit within the formal product specification hierarchy. They're designed to be:

- **Flexible**: No formal structure requirements—content is shaped by your needs
- **Independent**: Created at any time, outside the product specification workflow
- **Versatile**: Hold any type of content from meeting notes to technical guides
- **Template-ready**: Apply templates for consistency or start from scratch

## Common Use Cases

Documents excel at capturing the knowledge that surrounds and supports product development without cluttering your formal specifications.

## Documents vs. Product Hierarchy

The key distinction between Documents and [Product Artifacts](/features/product-artifacts) lies in their purpose and structure:

### Product Artifacts

Product Artifacts follow a defined hierarchy (Product → Capability → Feature → Requirement → Acceptance Criterion) designed for:

- Traceability from strategy to implementation
- AI agent consumption during development
- Structured specifications with consistent format
- Version-controlled product decisions

### Documents

Documents operate outside this hierarchy, providing:

- Freedom to structure content as needed
- A home for supporting knowledge and context
- Quick capture without formal requirements
- Organizational memory that persists alongside your product

The two complement each other. Research captured in a Document might inform Requirements. Meeting notes might reference Features under discussion. Use [artifact mentions](/features/editor#artifact-mentions) to connect related content across both types.

## Working with Documents

### Creating Documents

Create a new document from the documents section. Choose to:

1. **Start blank**: Begin with an empty document
2. **Use a template**: Apply a pre-built structure for common document types

### Templates

Templates provide consistent structure for recurring document types. Product Graph includes templates for common use cases:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business & Strategy">
    - **Company Mission & Vision**: Define organizational purpose and direction
    - **Strategy**: Capture strategic objectives and initiatives
    - **Lean Canvas**: One-page business model overview
    - **Key Insights**: Document unique perspectives and market opportunities
    - **Problem Statement**: Articulate the problem you're solving
    - **Solution Proposal**: Outline proposed solutions and approaches
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Planning & Communication">
    - **Six Pager**: Amazon-style narrative document for proposals
    - **Investor Elevator Pitch**: Concise pitch for investor conversations
    - **Seed Investor One-Pager**: Quick overview for seed funding
    - **Seed Investor Pitch**: Comprehensive investor presentation
    - **Hypothesis**: Document assumptions and testing plans
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product">
    - **SaaS Company Overview**: Comprehensive company and product overview
    - **Project**: Structured template for project documentation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Templates include placeholder text and section guidance to help you fill in the relevant information.

### Editing Documents

Documents use the same powerful [Editor](/features/editor) as all other artifacts in Product Graph:

- **Rich formatting**: Headings, lists, tables, code blocks, images
- **Slash commands**: Type `/` to insert blocks quickly
- **AI assistance**: Generate and refine content with AI
- **Artifact mentions**: Reference other documents and product artifacts with `@`
- **Real-time collaboration**: Work together with teammates simultaneously

### Archiving Documents

Documents you no longer need can be archived:

- **Archive**: Remove from active view without deleting
- **Restore**: Bring archived documents back when needed
- **Permanent delete**: Remove archived documents permanently

Archiving is preferred over deletion as it preserves document history and allows recovery if needed.

## Cross-Linking

Connect Documents to your product hierarchy using:

### Artifact Mentions

Type `@` in any document to reference:

- Products, Capabilities, Features
- Requirements, Acceptance Criteria
- User Types, Core Entities
- Projects and other Documents

Mentions create navigable links that help readers discover related content.

### Attachments

Attach documents to product artifacts to provide supplementary context:

- Attach research documents to Features they inform
- Link meeting notes to Projects they relate to
- Connect decision records to the artifacts they affect

Attachments create bidirectional relationships, making it easy to navigate between formal specifications and supporting documentation.

## Version History

Every document maintains a complete version history:

- **Automatic versioning**: New versions are created as you edit
- **Version browser**: Review previous versions of any document
- **Compare changes**: See how content evolved over time
- **Restore versions**: Return to an earlier version if needed

Version history ensures you never lose important content and can always trace how a document developed.

## Collaboration

Documents fully support [real-time collaboration](/features/collaboration):

- Multiple users can edit simultaneously
- Changes sync instantly across all connected sessions
- AI generation is visible to all collaborators
- Conflict-free editing with automatic merging

## Chat Integration

Each document has an integrated [Chat](/features/chat) panel for:

- Discussing the document with AI assistance
- Asking questions about the content
- Generating and refining sections through conversation
- Researching topics with web search

Chat conversations are saved with the document, preserving context for future reference.
