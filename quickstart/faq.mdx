### What is Product Graph?

Product Graph is a software requirements workspace for AI-first teams. It helps you turn scattered ideas into a clear, structured set of product artifacts, paired with an AI assistant to help you move faster from idea to shovel-ready requirements.

Modern teams build faster with AI coding agents, but the bottleneck has shifted to deciding what to build and why. Product context is scattered across docs and tools, inconsistent, and often outdated, making it hard for people and AI to rely on a single source of truth.

Collaborate in real-time with the assistant to draft and refine PRDs and feature specs, surface gaps, and clarify scope. Pull context from Notion, Confluence, and Google Drive, then push outputs to Linear and Jira. Requirements can also flow directly to coding agents via MCP (for example, Cursor, Devin, Claude, and Codex) so plans translate into action.

### Which AI provider/models do you use?

Product Graph uses state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to power its features. We select models that offer the best balance of quality and speed, continuously refining our integrations and updating them as new models become available. The specific models utilized vary depending on the deployment and use case.

### Is my data or writing used to train any AI models?

No, your data or writing is not used to train any AI models. Product Graph prioritizes user privacy and ensures that your content remains secure and confidential.

### Are my documents private?

Yes, your documents are private. Product Graph employs robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure storage, to protect your data. For enterprise users, additional features like private/self-hosted LLMs, SOC 2 compliance, and private deployments to secure private clouds are available. These options ensure that both enterprise and non-enterprise users can maintain full control over their data while benefiting from enhanced privacy and security.

### Can I use my own LLM model?

Yes, Product Graph supports the use of private/self-hosted LLMs for enterprise users. This allows organizations to integrate their own models while maintaining full control over their data and infrastructure.

### Do you have a privacy policy?

Yes, you can find our privacy policy and terms of service at [https://productgraph.ai/terms](https://productgraph.ai/terms). We are committed to protecting your data and being transparent about how it is used.

### How can I get help if I encounter an issue?
