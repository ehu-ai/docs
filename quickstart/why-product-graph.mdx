## Product Is the New Bottleneck

With AI agents like Cursor, Devin, and Codex accelerating development, engineering teams are moving faster than ever. The bottleneck has shifted upstream: deciding **what to build** and **why it matters**.

Product teams now struggle to keep up. Requirements are scattered, context is tribal, and documentation is stale. This slows everyone down: people and AI alike.

## The Cost of Fragmented Context

When product context is scattered and inconsistent, the consequences compound:

- **Misalignment**: Teams and AI agents don't know what matters, leading to wasted effort and conflicting priorities.
- **Duplicated work**: Without a source of truth, multiple people solve the same problems in different ways.
- **Missed details**: Critical requirements slip through the cracks when context lives in someone's head.
- **Slower onboarding**: New team members and AI agents can't ramp up quickly without structured, reliable documentation.
- **Regressions and rework**: Outdated specs lead to building the wrong thing, or rebuilding the right thing.
- **Lost confidence**: Without traceability and versioning, teams and AI can't trust or act on product information.

## How Product Graph Helps

**Product Graph** is a software requirements workspace for AI-first teams that captures the _what_ and _why_ in a structured way. It makes structured, machine-readable requirements the canonical source of truth so teams and agents can move from idea to impact with clarity and speed.

### From conversation to clarity

Convert discussions into structured PRDs and clear, LLM-optimized requirements in minutes. The AI assistant drives clarification and feedback, surfacing gaps and mapping key UX flows so teams and agents align before building, not after.

### Agent-ready by default

Turn complex ideas into small, buildable units with goals, context, and acceptance criteria. Your requirements translate directly into executable plans for agents like Cursor, Devin, and Codex.

### Living documentation

AI-assisted updates maintain agent-ready docs as scope and priorities change. Every change is versioned, reviewable, and reversible. No more stale specs causing regressions.

### Connected to your workflow

Pull from docs and wikis, push to planning and issue tracking, and bring requirements into MCP-compatible IDEs and AI clients. Product Graph integrates with Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Linear, and Jira for a connected source of truth.

## Built for AI-First Teams

Product Graph is designed from the ground up for how modern teams actually work.

**One source of truth.** No more hunting through Slack threads, Notion pages, and Google Docs to piece together what you're building. Structured requirements replace scattered prose, giving teams and AI agents a single place to look.

**Optimized for agents.** Every artifact is machine-readable and LLM-optimized. Your requirements don't just document intent; they translate directly into executable context for AI coding agents.

**Full traceability.** Every decision, requirement, and change is connected with complete version history. Know why something was built, when it changed, and who approved it. Roll back when needed.

**Fits your workflow.** Product Graph connects to the tools you already use through robust APIs and protocols like MCP. Pull context in, push requirements out, and keep everything in sync.

**Clear accountability.** Every artifact has an owner. Every change goes through an explicit review path. Whether updates come from humans or agents, the workflow stays auditable and controlled.
